# BareMetal STM32 #

============================================

This repo consists of a rather varied portfolio of trying to achieve bare metal access to microcontroller programming of a wide range of STM32 devices right from the super powerful ARM Cortex-M4F STM32F401RE Nucleo board to the modest and cost-effective STM32F030 having an ARM Cortex M0 core.
